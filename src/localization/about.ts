      paragraphOne: ` MeadTools came to me as an idea to help my mead making community
      while simultaneously kickstarting a new career in software
      development. There are several other tools to assist in mead making,
      but most are confusing to beginners, or, in my opinion incomplete.
      My hope is that MeadTools solves these issues.`,
      paragraphTwo: `Below I have listed all of the resources that I used in the creation
      of MeadTools as well as additional mead making resources. I can’t
      thank my personal mead community enough for making this project
      possible. I can be found on discord in the Doin’ the Most and Man
      Made Mead Mazer servers. My user name is larry_r. There is also a
      brand new MeadTools discord. I can be contacted through the contact
      page, linked on the bottom bar directly at contact@meadtools.com.`,
      paragraphThree: `MeadTools is completely open source under a MIT license, so if you
      want to check out the code, please have a look over on GitHub. If
      you use any of the code for anything fun, I just ask that you share
      it with me and the rest of the mead making community.`,
